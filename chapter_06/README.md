Chapter 6 - Baby Room Sentinel
==============================

Here the code from chapter 6 - "Baby Room Sentinel" of the book
"BeagleBone Home Automation Blueprints" written by Rodolfo Giometti
and published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78398-602-6).

This example code implements a baby room sentinel capable of
monitoring the room by detecting if the baby is crying or if the baby
is actually breathing during the sleep. Also, as a special feature,
the system will be able to measure the baby's temperature with a
contactless temperature sensor.
