Chapter 2 - Ultrasonic Park Assistant
=====================================

Here the code from chapter 2 - "Ultrasonic Park Assistant" of the book
"BeagleBone Home Automation Blueprints" written by Rodolfo Giometti
and published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78398-602-6).

This example code implements a park assistant that uses an ultrasonic
sensor to detect the distance between our car and the garage wall and
some LEDs to give to the driver a feedback of the car position in
order to avoid collisions.
