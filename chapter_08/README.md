Chapter 8 - Intrusions Detection System
=======================================

Here the code from chapter 8 - "Intrusions Detection System" of the
book "BeagleBone Home Automation Blueprints" written by Rodolfo
Giometti and published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78398-602-6).

This example code implements a low cost intrusion detection system
with a reasonable quality level by using our BeagleBone Black and two
(or more) webcams. The system will be able to alert the user by
sending an e-mail message with a photo of the intruder.
