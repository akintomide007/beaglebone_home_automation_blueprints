Chapter 1 - Dangerous gas sensors
=================================

Here the code from chapter 1 - "Dangerous gas sensors" of the book
"BeagleBone Home Automation Blueprints" written by Rodolfo Giometti
and published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78398-602-6).

This example code implements a device capable to monitor some
dangerous gas in a room as CO, Methane, LPG, etc. and then enabling an
acoustic and visive alarm in case of danger. Also, by using a GSM
module, the user will be able to send an SMS message to a predefined
phone number to alert, for instance, a relative.
