Chapter 4 - Google Docs Weather station
=======================================

Here the code from chapter 4 - "Google Docs Weather station" of the
book "BeagleBone Home Automation Blueprints" written by Rodolfo
Giometti and published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78398-602-6).

This example code implements a simple weather station that can be used
also as an Internet-of-Things device, in fact this time our BeagleBone
Black will collect environment data and then it will send them to a
remote database in order to be reworked and presented into a shared
environment.
