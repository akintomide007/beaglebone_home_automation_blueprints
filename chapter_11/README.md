Chapter 11 - Wireless Home Controller with Z-Wave
=================================================

Here the code from chapter 11 - "Wireless Home Controller with Z-Wave"
of the book "BeagleBone Home Automation Blueprints" written by Rodolfo
Giometti and published by Packt Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78398-602-6).

This example code implements a little wireless home controller by
using a Z-Wave controller connected with our BeagleBone Black and two
Z-Wave devices: a wall plug and a multi sensor device.
