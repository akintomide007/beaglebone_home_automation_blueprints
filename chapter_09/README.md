Chapter 9 - Twitter Access Control System with Smart Card and RFID
==================================================================

Here the code from chapter 9 - "Twitter Access Control System with
Smart Card and RFID" of the book "BeagleBone Home Automation
Blueprints" written by Rodolfo Giometti and published by Packt
Publishing (ISBN 978-1-78398-602-6).

These example codes show how to use a smart card reader as well as two
kinds of RFID readers (LF and UHF) in order to show different
possibilities to implement a minimal identifying system for access
control that can send an alert message to a Twitter account.
